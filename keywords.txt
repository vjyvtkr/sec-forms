customer relationships
.*[0-9]*%.* (*percent*)
sales (net sales, total sales, total net sales, *sales* can be associated with *to* and *its subcontractors, subsidaries*)
revenue (net revenue, total revenue, total net revenue)

      So basically in sales and revenue, these 2 words act as nouns, and have adjectives as its prior word
      and can be associated with another noun with a to tag. Can again be followed by Adverb(s)

customer/distributor (*customer/distributor* can be associated with *wholesale/retail/(any adjective)*)
(even *sales/revenue* can be associated with adjectives like *wholesale/retail*)
Also look for company names (can create a db of company names). If no company names, look for *customer(s) + revenue/sales*

.* $[0-9]*\.[0-9]* [[million][s]]* [accounts/whatever].*

receivable?

sales volume -> sales is a plural noun and volume is a singular noun
